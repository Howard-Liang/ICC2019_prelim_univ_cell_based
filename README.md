Top module: CONV.v

## Executing Program

A testbench code (./testfixture.v) and several golden data were provided by the contest host.  
The RTL behavior of the chip can be simulated by using the following command: 
```
$ ncverilog -f rtl_01.f +access+r
```
To see the simulated wave form, use nWave
```
$ nWave &
```
to read the fsdb files generated by ncverilog.  

The gate-level circuit can be tested by using the following command:
```
$ ncverilog -f rtl_02.f +access+r
```
